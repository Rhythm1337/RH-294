# Understanding the playbook
## 1. Lets clone the Repo
### git clone https://gitlab.com/rgdacosta/classroom_env.git

## 2. Go in the directory
### cd classroom_env/

## 3. Run the playbook
ansible-navigator run --ee false -m stdout playbook.yml

> **-ee false** is execution envoirnment set to false as you need to transact against localhost and not the execution envoirnment

## 4. Read the playbook and understand the modules and take a look at the functions used.
### vim playbook.yml

# Modifying and Copying Files to Hosts example
## 1. Making a simple yml file to backup a certain file or directory
### vim part2.yml

```
---
- name: Ensure backups are taken
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  gather_facts: true
  vars:
    backup_target: /etc
    backup_store: /var/tmp/backup
    backup_format: xz
    backup_file: /var/tmp{{ backup_target | basename}}_{{ansible_facts['date_time']['iso8601'] }}.tar.{{ backup_format }}
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure {{ backup_store }} exists
      become: false
      delegate_to: localhost
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "{{ backup_store }}/{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        owner: student
        state: directory
        
    - name: Ensure backup of {{ backup_target }} exists
      community.general.archive:
        path: "{{ backup_target }}"
        dest: "{{ backup_file }}"
        format: "{{ backup_format }}"
        
    - name: Ensure backup is stored on controller
      ansible.builtin.fetch:
        src: "{{ backup_file }}"
        
    - name: Ensure backup is stored on controller
      ansible.builtin.fetch:
        src: "{{ backup_file }}"
        dest: "{{ backup_store }}/{{ inventory_hostname }}/"
        flat: true
```
## 2. Run the playbook
### ansible-navigator run false -m stdout playbook.yml
> you should run a syntax check before running the playbook by adding **--syntax-check**
