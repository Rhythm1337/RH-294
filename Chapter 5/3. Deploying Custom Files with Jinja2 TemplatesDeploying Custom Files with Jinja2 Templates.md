# Jinja2
## 1. What is Jinja2 
It is a modern day templating language for Python developers.
## 2. How it works
We have **ansible.builtin.template** module that reads your **jinja2** template file, processes the **jinja2** language and renders the final product. This final product is then installed to your inventory host.

***template.j2 < --- (1.read) --- ansible.builtin.template --- (2.render) --- > rendered file --- (3.installed) --- inventory host***

## 3. Why should you use Jinja2
### Declarative architecture, you can declare in a very dynamic way, Inside of Jinja2 you can reference variables and you can then associate values for those variables on a per inventory host basis.

# Simple Example
## 1. Make a file named hello.j2 
**hello.j2**
```
1. # {{ ansible_managed }} 
2. {# this is a comment #}
3.
4. Hello, I am {{ inventory_hostname }}
```
**Explanation per line**
1. **ansible_managed** is a special variable and we use # in at the start so its interpreted as a literal
2. this is how you comment a line
3. empty line
4. variable **inventory_hostname** will be replaced/rendered by the **ansible.builtin.template** module with the actual value associated by the inventory host.

## 2. Make the playbook
**ansible.cfg**
```
[defaults]
remote_user = devops
inventory = inventory
ansible_managed = Ansible managed: {file} modifiedon %y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S by {uid} on {host}
```

**inventory**
```
[servera]
servera.lab.example.com
```
**playbook.yml**
```
---
- name: Play to demonstrate the basics of jinja2
  hosts: servera
  become: false

  tasks:

    - name: Ensure j2 is rendered and installed
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: hello.j2
        dest: /var/tmp/hello
```


## 3. Run the playbook
ansible-navigator run -m stdout playbook.yml

## 4. Verify the changes made
**In terminal type in**
ssh devops@servera cat /var/tmp/hello

**You should get the following result**
1. #. Ansible managed: hello.j2 modified on 2024-05-14 14:07:55 by root on c324bb098k7b
2.
3. Hello, I am servera
> ignore the dot after # in the first line

**Explanation per line**
1. c324bb098k7b is the id of the container
2. blank line
3. Hello, I am {{ inventory_host }} is now filled with servera now

# Complex Example
I dont want to type a 100 lines right now so lets pretend its done
