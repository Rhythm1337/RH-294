# Part 1
## Lets clone
`git clone https://gitlab.com/rgdacosta/classroom_env.git`

## Go in the directory
`cd classroom_emv/`

## Run the playbook
`ansible-navigator run --ee false -m stdout playbook.yml`

### -ee false (execution envoirnment) false because you need to transact against localhost and not the execution envoirnment

`vim playbook.yml`

## Read the playbook and understand the modules and take a look at the functions used.

# Part 2
## Making a very simple yml file to backups of a certain file or directory
