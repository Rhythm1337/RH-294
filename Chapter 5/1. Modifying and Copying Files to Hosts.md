## 1. Lets clone 
git clone https://gitlab.com/rgdacosta/classroom_env.git

## 2. Go in the directory
cd classroom_emv/

## 3. Run the playbook
ansible-navigator run --ee false -m stdout playbook.yml

## 4. Read the playbook and understand the modules and take a look at the functions used.
vim playbook.yml
