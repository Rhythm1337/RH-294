# 1. Creating Roles
## Creating my_role1 role
```ansible-galaxy init my_role1```
## Viewing the created files
``` tree -F my_role1/```

**tasks/main.yml**

```
# tasks file for motd

- name: transfer motd file
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0444
```

**motd.j2**
```
This is the system {{ ansible_facts['hostname'] }}

Todays date is: {{ ansible_facts['date_time']['date'] }}

Only use this system with permission.
You can ask {{ system_owner }} for access.
```

**defaults/main.yml**
```
system_owner: rhythm@Rhythm-Ubuntu
```

# 2. Recommended Practices for Role Content Development
- Reuse roles
- Create and maintain README.md and meta/main.yml files to document the roles purpose and author
- Remote any unnecary files if you arent using them.
- Avoid storing sensitive information such as passwords and SSH keys. If there is something sensitive then use Ansible Vault variable
