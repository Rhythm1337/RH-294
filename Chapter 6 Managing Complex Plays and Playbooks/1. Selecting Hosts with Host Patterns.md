# Selecting Hosts with Host Patterns
# Example
## 1.Making The Playbook
**ansible.cfg**
```
inventory = inventory
```

**inventory**
```
[rhel]
server[a:b]

[fedora]
server[c:d]

[webservers]
servera
serverc

[dbservers]
serverb
serverd
```
## 2. Listing Inventory Hosts
ansible --list all
> Lists all hosts in the inventory
 
**output**
```
hosts (4)
servera
serverb
serverc
serverd
```
ansible --list 'webservers:&rhel'
> Lists the servers which are part of the webservers group and they must also be a part of rhel invemtory group

**output**
```
hosts (1)
servera
```
ansible --list 'webservers:fedora'
> Lists the servers which are part of the webservers group and they must also be a part of fedora invemtory group

**output**
```
hosts (1)
serverc
```
ansible --list 'webservers:!fedora'
> Lists the servers which are part of the webservers group and but they must not be a part of fedora invemtory group

**output**
```
hosts (1)
servera
```
ansible --list 'webservers:dbservers'
> Lists the servers which are part of webservers group then lists the servers which are part of dbservers inventory group

**output**
```
hosts (4)
servera
serverc
serverb
serverd
```
